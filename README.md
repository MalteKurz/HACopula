# The HACopula Toolbox
## Hierarchical Archimedean copulas for MATLAB

## Description:
The HACopula toolbox extends the copula modeling provided by MATLAB to modeling with hierarchical Archimedean copulas, which allows for non-elliptical distributions in arbitrary dimensions enabling for asymmetries in the tails. This includes their representation as MATLAB objects, evaluation, sampling, estimation and goodness-of-fit testing, as well as tools for their visual representation or computation of corresponding Kendall's tau and tail dependence coefficients.

## Installation:
It is enough to unpack the files to a selected folder and to add this folder with its subfolders to the MATLAB path. For the full functionality, the toolbox requires Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and Symbolic Math Toolbox.

## Examples:
Three examples covering most of the functionality provided by the toolbox are placed in the folder Demos, namely quickex.m, elaboratedex.m and highdimex.m.
