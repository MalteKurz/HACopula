    %HACopula - The class of hierarchical Archimedean copula (HAC) models
    %
    % As a HAC can be viewed as a set of generators (representing
    % Archimedean copulas) that are recursively nested into each other, an
    % object from the HACopula class is also defined recursively. This
    % means, instantiating a HACopula object, it contains a description of
    % the generator at the root of the HAC structure, which is given by the
    % family and the parameter of the generator, and a cell array of
    % HACopula objects or integers, which represent the children (another
    % HACs or leaves) of a generator in the HAC structure. Hence the
    % three essential properties of a HACopula object are Family,
    % Parameter and Child. The rest of the properties are closely related
    % to (and hence useful for) HAC models (Level, Tau, TauOrdering) or are
    % used for increasing computational efficiency (Leaves, Parent, Root,
    % Forks).
    %
    % Note that HACopula is a handle class, i.e., modifications of a
    % HACopula object passed as an input to a function that modifies this
    % input are propagated to the input object. If a method is modifying
    % its HACopula input object, this is stressed out in the help of this
    % function. To prevent a HACopula object from modification in such
    % functions, use the copy method and pass the copied object to these
    % functions.
    %
    % Also note that we will sometimes use the term "fork" instead of
    % "generator", as there is a clear relationship between these two,
    % e.g., see [Górecki et al., 2016b].

    properties
        Family          % A family label from {'A', 'C', 'F', 'G', 'J', '12', '14', '19', '20', '?'}, where
                        % A = Ali-Mikhal-Haq, C = Clayton,
                        % F = Frank,
                        % G = Gumbel,
                        % J = Joe, and
                        % 12, 14, 19 and 20 - see page 116 in [Nelsen,
                        % 2006].
                        % The parametric forms of the families listed above
                        % can be found in the function getgenerator. The family '?' is an
                        % auxiliary family that is used in cases, when one
                        % wants to estimate (or also to collapse)
                        % the structure of a HAC without any assumptions on
                        % the generators of the underlying HAC. This family
                        % thus cannot be used for purposes of parameter
                        % estimation. Also note that, to allow this
                        % family to be a valid family of HACopula, its
                        % parameter is arbitrarily defined to be equal to
                        % the Kendall's tau.
        Parameter       % A real value >= 0.
        Tau             % The value of Kendall's tau corresponding to Parameter 
                        % and Family.
        TauOrdering     % The order of the generator in the tau ordering 
                        % defined by the function addtauordering. Serves as an identifier of of the fork.
        Level           % The nesting level of a generator (Level = 1 for the root).
        Leaves          % A cell array containing all descendant leaves of the actual fork.
        % HACopula handles
        Child           % A cell array of child (HACopula) objects.
        Parent          % [], if Level = 1, otherwise it contains the (HACopula) parent of this object.
        Root            % The (HACopula) root of this  object.
        Forks           % A cell array with HACopula objects containing all 
                        % descendant forks of this fork including this
                        % fork.
